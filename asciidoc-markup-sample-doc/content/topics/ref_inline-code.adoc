= Inline Code or Commands
Do NOT show full commands or command syntax inline within a sentence.

Only use case for inline commands would be general commands and operations,
without replaceables and command options.
In this case an inline command is marked up using the back ticks:

....
Use the `GET` operation to do x.
....

This renders as:

Use the `GET` operation to do x.
