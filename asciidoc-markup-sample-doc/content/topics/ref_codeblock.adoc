= Code blocks
Code blocks are used to show examples of command screen outputs,
or configuration files.
When using command blocks always use the actual values
for any items that a user would normally replace.

For all code blocks, you must include an empty line above a code block.

Acceptable:

....
Lorem ipsum

----
$ lorem.sh
----
....

Not acceptable:

....
Lorem ipsum
----
$ lorem.sh
----
....

Without the line spaces the content is likely to be not parsed correctly.

For commands in codeblocks, *bold* the relevant command sections.

....
Find your CPU information.

----
$ *lscpu*
----
....

This renders as

Find your CPU information.

----
$ *lscpu*
----
