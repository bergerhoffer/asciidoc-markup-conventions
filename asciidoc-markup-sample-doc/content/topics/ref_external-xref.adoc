= Links to External Websites

If you want to link to a different website, use:

----
http://othersite.com/otherpath[friendly descriptor]
----

TIP: If you want to build a link from a URL _without_
changing the text from the actual URL,
just print the URL without adding a `[friendly text]` block at the end;
it will automatically be rendered as a link.
