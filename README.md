# asciidoc-markup-conventions

The Asciidoc-markup-conventions initiative tries to identify the best practises and styles for the AsciiDoc Markup that is to be used in Red Hat documents. The matter was discussed heavily across all Red Hat documentation teams to reach an agreement on marking up various elements used in the documentation.

As a result, we have come up with a quick reference of the AsciiDoc markup. You can find the latest results at https://redhat-documentation.github.io/asciidoc-markup-conventions.
